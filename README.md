# learn-custom-hooks

A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with **use** and that may call other Hooks. 
Unlike a React component, a custom Hook doesn’t need to have a specific signature. We can decide what it takes as arguments, and what, if anything, it should return. In other words, it’s just like a normal function. Its name should always start with use so that you can tell at a glance that the rules of Hooks apply to it.
